resume_templates.py — Role-specific resume data and generators.

This module holds every role template (skills, projects, experience,
certifications, achievements) and exposes two generators:

    generate_pdf_resume(role_key, profile) -> bytes   (ATS-friendly PDF)
    make_latex_resume(template, basics)    -> str      (LaTeX source)

Profile dict (loaded from .env by main.py):
    name, email, phone, location, linkedin, github, portfolio,
    education, graduation_year

Public helpers:
    list_templates()          -> summary list of all roles
    get_template(role_key)    -> full template dict or None
